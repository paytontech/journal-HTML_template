        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>so to start this off, we launched on <a href="https://paytontech.github.iohttp://www.paytondev.xyz/2021">Github Pages</a> which is cool</p>
        <p>however we have a few issues here</p>
        <p>i recently organized the pages with a new folder layout (yay!!) but that basically broke the entire website (oh ...)</p>
        <p>so now I have to go through every single reference to every single file/image and change it up slightly to make it so navigation works</p>
        <p>there are much more things broken than navigation, but navigation is really the thing that matters most here</p>
        <p>so for now i'm gonna work on getting navigation working, then i'll get the rest working later today</p>
        <p>alright i'm gonna get it working now</p>
        <p>cya for now</p>
        <h1>OH MY GOD YES I GOT IT WORKING !!</h1>
