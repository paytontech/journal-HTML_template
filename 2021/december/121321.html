        <p>winter break starts Friday</p>
        <p>it's going to be painful getting through this final week, but i'll make it</p>
        <p>i have science midterms on the 15th&16th which sucks but its whatever</p>
        <p>my birthday is also on saturday</p>
        <p>the 18th</p>
        <p>which is nice</p>
        <p>a bit of a reward for getting through the final week of 2021</p>
        <p>the break is going to be for a few weeks, which is nice</p>
        <p>its a reasonable amount of time off :)</p>
        <p>i simply cannot wait</p>
        <p>i expect wednesday, thursday, and friday to be pretty calm because of midterms, tests, watching movies, etc.</p>
        <p>i finished a project in ELA that was due wednesday so i basically have 2 free days in ELA</p>
       <p>and thursday and friday should also be free days in that class because we're just listening to the teacher presenting peoples projects</p>
       <p>thats right - the teacher is presenting peoples's projects - not us (which is a LIFESAVER)</p>
       <p>so yeah</p>
       <p>i'm excited for these next few days (for once)</p>
       <p>alright then</p>
       <p>cya</p>
