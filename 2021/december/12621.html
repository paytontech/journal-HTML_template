      <h1>PSA: group projects are not good<br>12/6/21, 11:14 AM</h1>
      <b>
        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>i am currently working on 2 different group projects in 2 different classes: ELA and STEM</p>
        <p>stem is just me and another person, and ela is me and 5 others</p>
        <p>*side rant here but there is one person in my ELA class with the name Payton, and we are in the same group (groups were chosen by the teacher). its so confusing having to figure out who a  group member is talking to when they call out "Payton".</p>
        <p>but anyways</p>
        <p>both of the groups have no idea what is happening</p>
        <p>the ELA group just talked about things completely off-topic, and STEM group just went terribly</p>
        <p>so now in ELA, we have to finish basically the ENTIRE project tomorrow in class in the span of like an hour</p>
        <p>we have to make 2 posters, each containing about 5 things, and fill out a question sheet \</p>
        <p>and in STEM, the robot we're building was just assembled completely incorrectly by the people before us (we share robots between periods), and so we just kinda did nothing and hoped that the 4 periods before us would fix everything for us</p>
        <p>and plus i didnt even get to build the things that we would've been able to because the other person WOULDN'T LET ME!</p>
        <p>i'm hoping he'll let me do the programming part, because that's the part i'm most excited for, anyways.</p>
        <p>so yeah</p>
        <p>not. good.</p>
        <p>oh yeah im also working on a website for my domain name (<a href="http://paytondev.xyz">paytondev.xyz</a>) and i plan for it to be hosted on github</p>
        <p>so expect that soon :)</p>
        <p>oh uhhh</p>
        <p>okay so the site is pretty messed up atm but it's FINE</p>
        <p>okay im gonna start working on it now, cya</p>
