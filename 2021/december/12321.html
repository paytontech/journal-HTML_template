        <p>i just finished my social studies test and got a 48/50 on it (96%)</p>
        <p>anyways im like 99% sure i forgot to say that i finished redesigning the <a href="navigationbeta.html">naivgation page</a>. that link leads to navigation.html, but if you're reading this in the future, it's probably at <a href="/navigation.html">navigate.htmk</a>, so go there instead :)</p>
        <p>it looks way better in my opinion</p>
        <p>i organized the website into seperate folders (seperated by month) and that kinda just broke everthing so i'm gonna do some cool coding stuff to make it work again</p>
        <p>and until then, i'll cya later</p>
