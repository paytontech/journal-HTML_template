        <p>ok i finished part 1 of my midterm so ehre i am</p>
        <p>*here</p>
        <p>even though i finished part 1, that doesnt mean i am done with midterms</p>
        <p>i have to do part 2 tomorrow </p>
        <p>THEN i can be done</p>
        <p>although id consider myself one of the lucky people</p>
        <p>science is my only high-school level class, so i only have to do this science midterm</p>
        <p>but some people have more than just science as a high-school level class, so they have to do multiple midterms</p>
        <p>some people's midterms are all on the same day</p>
        <p>not me though because i am way too lazy to get more than one high school classes</p>
        <p>i forgot about a project i had due today for a STEM thing we're doing in IE</p>
        <p>i did the project but i simply forgot to bring it to school</p>
        <p>so hopefully i can remember it tomorrow</p>
        <p>speaking of tommorow: 2 more days until break not counting today</p>
        <p>that has nothing to do with tomorrow but its fine</p>
        <p>i changed up the navigation page a bit, hopefully it looks good</p>
        <p>sorry, the navigation BETA</p>
        <p>speaking of which, i plan on taking navigation.html out of beta and making it the main navigation page</p>
        <p>sooooo</p>
        <p>yeah</p>
        <p>that midterm was actually surprisingly easy</p>
        <p>i finished it in like 20 minutes</p>
        <p>although i think tomorrows midterm will be slightly harder, because it deals with balencing equations and whatnot</p>
        <p>alright then</p>
        <p>i have basically a free-period next period so i'll see ya in about 10 minutes</p>
        <h1>ok i am back<br>12/15/21 10:39 AM</h1>
        <p>yep i am back</p>
        <p>sorry about that wait, it took a bit for the internet to get back working lol</p>
        <p>well then</p>
        <p>uhh</p>
        <p>the tech teacher got another iMac that me and a few friends supposedly get to set up later today</p>
        <p>it will be during ie so dont expect anything today during then</p>
        <p>unless we dont set it up</p>
        <p>in which case expect something during then</p>
        <p>the main reason i havent been able to write here during ie is because of the imac that i got to help set up</p>
        <p>it has had so many issues lately</p>
        <p>first it was that my friend apparently wiped the entire drive of the thing, so we had to completely reinstall macOS</p>
        <p>then the teacher wanted Xcode (which isnt that big of an issue) until you realize that this thing runs macOS High Sierra</p>
        <p>which definitely does not support the latest version of Xcode that you can just download from the app store.</p>
        <p>so i had to go home, install Xcode 10.3, put it in a flash drive, then bring it back to school to install Xcode</p>
        <p>BUT WAIT! It turns out that Xcode 10.3 doesn't support High Sierra, only 10.0 supports High Sierra for some reason</p>
        <p>so i had to wait until school was over, head home, redownload Xcode 10.0, THEN, AND ONLY THEN, I could come back to school with the flash drive, and install Xcode.</p>
        <p>and it worked!</p>
        <p>and now i get to set up another mac</p>
        <p>and hey, i'm not complaining, i love these things</p>
        <p>i'm just describing why i havent been able to write in here during IE lately</p>
        <p>goodbye</p>
