        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>you may remember yesterday me ranting about group projects</p>
        <p>and i can confidently say that (at least for ELA) we have redeemed ourselves</p>
        <p>we are almost basically done and I'd consider most of us somewhat friends now :)</p>
        <p>this is the true power of being threatened by the project being due tomorow and having no work doneüëç</p>
        <p>wow</p>
        <p>today is a really good day</p>
        <p>im not very tired, the teacher is playing what sounds like calm jazz music, life is good</p>
        <p>awesome</p>
        <p>well then</p>
        <p>i'll cya tomorow (unless i die, then i wont)</p>
