        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>we are now in double digits for the month of december. it is now december 10th!</p>
        <p>it means literlly nothing but still</p>
        <p>so then</p>
        <p>i am in social studies</p>
        <p>and i finished my assignment</p>
        <p>life is good</p>
        <p>i forgot to do this yesterday. i was busy working on some homework</p>
        <p>so, sorry about that</p>
        <p>ok i will update more in IE today</p>
        <p>or maybe i wont</p>
        <p>depends on what we do for "fun day" today</p>
        <p>cya</p>
        <h1>back again<br>same day, 10:55 AM</h1>
        <p>wow cool neat here i am again wow awesome fun & cool & very family friendly & awesome + cool</p>
        <p>i finished all my assignments so here i am</p>
        <p>just a quick reminder that we're up on github pages over at <a href="https://paytontech.github.io/navigation.html">https://paytontech.github.io/navigation.html</a></p>
        <p>so check that out</p>
        <p>i just realized that i probably didn't have to remind you because odds are you're on that page right now to read this.</p>
        <p>but on the off-chance you're reading this on a local machine, hello</p>
        <p>oh yeah</p>
        <p>my school literally blocked GOOGLE</p>
        <p>i needed to know something for a project in Python, and Google-ing anything non-school related just blocks the page lol</p>
        <p>don't quite know what's up with that but whatever</p>
        <p>uhhhh</p>
        <p>well then</p>
        <p>cya!</p>
        <h1>a THREE PARTER??<br>12/10/21 1:38 AM</h1>
        <p>i finished everything already</p>
        <p>anyways</p>
        <p>my laptop is on like 5% charge so if things go south i won't be able to commit this and this will never see the light of day</p>
        <p>so consider this a special edition</p>
        <p>hi</p>
        <p>someone from my class wrote that ^</p>
        <p>the new <a href="/navigation.html">navigation beta </a>has been in beta for a while now, I think i'll make the beta the new default navigation next friday</p>
        <p>i'm gonna be working on this website a bit behind the scenes during winter break</p>
        <p>basically i'm (probably) not gonna be making new pages, but i'll still do bug fixes and change designs and whatnot</p>
        <p>ok my laptop is on 3% and it is reporting about 10 minutes left</p>
        <p>we're gonna keep going until this thing hits 1%</p>
        <p>i'll even screen record it</p>
        <p>ok screen recording started</p>
        <p>worst case scenerio the laptop dies, corrupting the video, which means you guys will probably have no idea what i'm even talking about</p>
        <p>2%!!!</p>
        <p>this screen recording probably isn't helping the battery either</p>
        <p>i'm gonna commit this now but i'm not stopping the screen recording</p>
        <p>cya!!!</p>
