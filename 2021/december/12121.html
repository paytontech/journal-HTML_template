        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>yes it is 1:26 PM</p>
        <p>i didn't do this 2 hours ago because i was having trouble getting github to work correctly</p>
        <p>so i couldn't pull the site from github via vscode</p>
        <p>oh yeah i should probably mention that this is up on <a href="github.com/paytontechhttp://www.paytondev.xyz/2021">github</a> now</p>
        <p>so thats awesome</p>
        <p>it's more than just people being able to see this now. now, the school can't just go and remove the entire site off of literally every school computer i use, because as far as i know, the school admins do not have my GitHub login info. I've also use git clone + a simple python script to start doing a daily backup of the site to a personal server, so even if they SOMEHOW take it down from GitHub, it's still on a personal computer that the school can probably not get to.</p>
        <p>i've noticed that now that i'm using vscode instead of code.org i can do JS stuff for the site now</p>
        <p>which is something i've never been able to do until i moved to vscode</p>
        <p>it's pretty awesome</p>
        <p>they also have a <a href="vscode.dev">web client,</a> so i can edit this basically anywhere. it's awesome!</p>
        <p>anyways happy december</p>
        <p>break starts on the 17th, so expect nothing from then until probably January 4th</p>
        <p>im getting ahead of myself</p>
        <p>it's 2 weeks</p>
        <p>anyways cya</p>
