        <p>school is almost over !</p>
        <p>you know what else is over? midterms!</p>
        <p>i finished part 2, and am somewhat confident that i somewhat got somewhat of the answers somewhat right.</p>
        <p>it was pretty simple (then again i did study for like 3 hours at home one night)</p>
        <p>i dont usually study for things, but this one counts against my High School GPA, so i figured that i should probably make an exception for this</p>
        <p>speaking of which</p>
        <p>i turn 14 in 2 days</p>
        <p>turning 14 isnt as big as turning 13 in my opinion</p>
        <p>because you get so many freedoms as a 13 year old</p>
        <p>for example you can now (legally) sign up for internet accounts</p>
        <p>and what do you get when you turn 14?</p>
        <p>the ability to get a job (sort of)</p>
        <p>you have to be 14 and a half, and not everyone hires 14 year olds (understandably)</p>
        <p>yay jobs woohooo</p>
        <p>speaking of jobs</p>
        <p>i finished the Steve Jobs book about a week ago</p>
        <p>i also finished breaking bad a week ago</p>
        <p>both are great, but the Steve Jobs book was the only book i have that i can take to school (and not get bullied)</p>
        <p>and so without a book, there's not much to do</p>
        <p>i just kinda have to sit and stare at my desk while i wait for class to get started</p>
        <p>which is boring</p>
        <p>i definitely need a book tomorrow because most classes will just be free time</p>
        <p>and staring at a table for 7 hours straight is not very fun</p>
        <p>i am really excited for tomorrow purely because it is the last day of school (at least for 2021)</p>
        <p>speaking of tomorrow</p>
        <p>i need to think of what im going to write before i write it</p>
        <p>nothing important is happening tomorrow (at least to my knowledge)</p>
        <p>speaking of knowledge</p>
        <p>there i go again</p>
        <p>i have nothing to talk about knowledge</p>
        <p>but yeah</p>
        <p>midterms done, tests done, assignments done, everything school-wise done, and now i just have to get through the rest of today and tomorrow</p>
        <p>then i can basically do whatever i want for like 3 weeks</p>
        <p>possibly 2</p>
        <p>i dont know</p>
        <p>i had to set up the mac in IE today so naturally there was nothing</p>
        <p>and by "set up" i mean i just reinstalled macOS</p>
        <p>i still need to get data transferred and the actualy OS setup, so dont expect anything from IE today :)</p>
        <p>oh yeah did i mention that i got a dog a while ago</p>
        <p>it was like mid-november and i cannot remember if i mentioned her or not</p>
        <p>but yeah we have 2 dogs now</p>
        <p>i wouldn't consider them puppies (anymore), but i wouldnt exactly consider them adults.</p>
        <p>they're kinda in the middle</p>
        <p>both are around the same age</p>
        <p>i just realized that the way im saying this sounds like we got 2 dogs in 1 day</p>
        <p>no</p>
        <p>we got them like a year apart</p>
        <p>actually wait</p>
        <p>it was actually exactly a year apart</p>
        <p>hmm</p>
        <p>thats cool i guess</p>
        <p>but yeah so they're around the same age</p>
        <p>born around September (i'm pretty sure one of them was born on the 19th, not so sure about the other one)</p>
        <p>and yeah</p>
        <p>i'll add some pictures of them here when I get home</p>
        <p>alright then</p>
        <p>cya!</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/AlBas123">This is an awesome repo please check this out 10/10 quality - payton (legit) </a></p>
        <p>my name is </p>
        <h1>mhm here we are<br>12/16/21, 1:29 PM</h1>
        <p>"free" day in 7th period today because reasons</p>
        <p>i have no clue at all as to why but hey, im not complaining.</p>
        <p>we're really doing a kahoot/trivia type thing but while im waiting for the questions time to end, im writing here</p>
        <p>im gonna make the navigation button lead to the new navigation page now</p>
        <p>i'm also gonna rename navigatebeta to navigation.html because why not</p>
        <p>i'll probably make a new file and just make navigation.html redirect to it so i dont break anything THAT bad lol</p>
        <p>gonna do that now</p>
        <p>ok i *think* i did it</p>
        <p>hopefully it worked</p>
        <p>if it doesn't, i'll just try it at home on an actual copy of vscode, not just vscode.dev</p>
        <p>alrighty then commiting this</p>
        <p>hopefully i dont break everything!</p>
        <h1>famous last words<br>12/16/21, 2:32 PM</h1>
        <p>i am here in the gym at 2:32 PM</p>
        <p>why am i here in the gym at 2:23 PM, you ask?</p>
        <p>well, it's pretty simple</p>
        <p>my bus is a hold</p>
        <p>so now i have to wait here in the gym for like 20 more minutes for another bus to get here to pick me up</p>
        <p>ah, the perks of riding a bus :|</p>
        <p>although i do get to write here so does it *really* matter?</p>
        <p>so anyways remember when i said "hopefully i dont break everything"? well, i broke everything.</p>
        <p>hopefully with this commit its fixed but if its not then too bad</p>
        <p>you're gonna have to WAIT until I have the time to fix it</p>
        <p>anyways</p>
        <p>im just kinda sitting here</p>
        <p>wait theyre calling my bus goodbye</p>
