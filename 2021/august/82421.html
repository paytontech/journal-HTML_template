    <p>OK WE NEED TO TALK.</p>
    <p>A lot happened yesterday</p>
    <p>First off, I didn't update the site yesterday because we couldn't use the computers, because we had to go to the auditoium for a presentation.</p>
    <p>Second off, I WAS SO TIRED YESTERDAY.</p>
    <div/>
    <h1>I got like 5 hours of sleep.</h1>
    <p>That seems like a lot (at least to me)</p>
    <p>BUT, I woke up in the middle of the night</p>
    <p>And in an effort to go back to sleep, I took a melatonin to try to get to sleep</p>
    <h6>i didnt go back to sleep.</h6>
    <p>So here I am, 7 in the morning, running off a melatonin and 5 hours of sleep</p>
    <p>anyways I have to work on a project thing for tech class so cya</p>
