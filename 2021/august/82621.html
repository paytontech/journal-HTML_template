    <h1>Think Five :) (8/26/21 11:13 AM EST)</h1>
    <p>no but my school has signs hanging basically everywhere with the text "Think" on it with an image of basic memmoriabilia (spelled that wrong lol) of the number five</p>
    <p>Here is a list of all the images of the number five i've seen: <br>(including, but not limited to) <br>-Dice <br>-Interstate Signs <br>-Hands</p>
    <p>and i dont know what it means</p>
    <p>maybe a plot to get us all to actually like this school??</p>
    <p>no, thats impossible</p>
