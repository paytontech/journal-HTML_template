    <h1>*among us loud sound thing* <br> 8/25/21 11:14 AM EST</h1>
    <p>I haven't even met my 4th period teacher yet and it has officially been a week since school started</p>
    <p>It only goes downhill from here</p>
    <p>I can't explain in (school appropriate) words how much I hate those "about me" sheets teachers give on the first day of school</p>
    <p>like bro why do you want to know more about me</p>
    <p>I barely know myself and you want me to tell you EVERYTHING?!</p>
    <p>one of said sheets is in said 4th period class</p>
    <p>we're supposed to be making a poem out of these things</p>
    <p>(keep reading trust me it gets worse)</p>
    <p>And so they want 6 words in each box. there are 8 boxes.</p>
    <p>And I've already struggled finding 6 words for each box.</p>
    <p>But I don't care too much because I did do it.</p>
    <p>The one I did have an issue on is literally the stupidest name for a box that needs six words</p>
    <p>The box is "Who Wonders..."</p>
    <p>like WHAT?!</p>
    <p>what does that even mean</p>
    <p>I don't really wonder too much and the stuff I do wonder I just look up on google!</p>
    <p>for example: "what language is iOS written in?"</p>
    <p>one google search later:</p>
    <p>"There Are Two Main Languages That Power iOS: Objective-C and Swift" -blog.devmountain.com</p>
    <p>like why tho <br>its literally so easy to google anything we wonder <br>so i dont wonder much</p>
    <p>so anyways coding is cool</p>
