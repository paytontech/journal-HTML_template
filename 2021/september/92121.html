    <h1>DO YOU REMEMBER??????????? 21ST NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER????????? <br>9/21/21 11:13 AM EST </h1>
    <p>Do you remember, 21st night of September?
      Love was changing the mind of pretenders
      While chasing the clouds away
      Our hearts were ringing
      In the key that our souls were singing
      As we danced in the night
      Remember
      How the stars stole the night away, oh yeah
      Hey, hey, hey
      Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
      Ba-dee-ya, dancing in September
      Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
      Ba-du, ba-du, ba-du, ba-du
      Ba-du, ba-du, ba-du, ba-du
      Ba-du, ba-du, ba-du-da, yeah
      My thoughts are with you
      Holding hands with your heart to see you
      Only blue talk and love
      Remember
      How we knew love was here to stay
      Now December
      Found the love we shared in September
      Only blue talk and love
      Remember
      True love we share today
      Hey, hey, hey

      Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
      Ba-dee-ya, dancing in September
      Ba-dee-ya, golden dreams were shiny days
      The bell was ringing, oh, oh
      Our souls was singing
      Do you remember, never a cloudy day, yow

    <p>its september 21st aka the one song from a few years ago day</p>
    <p>i made a new watch app</p>
    <p>im getting a book today to read at school when I have nothing better to do, and I have trouble keeping track of my pages, so I made an app that does it for me</p>
    <p>it was actually REALLY easy to make (once I actualyl figured out a method of how to do it...)</p>
    <p>I spent LITERAL HOURS trying to find methods that were compatible with watchOS 6 - the Operating System my 5 year old Apple Watch runs</p>
    <p>typically, I would just use @AppStorage, but that requires watchOS 7 or later.</p>
    <p>So then I tried Core Data <br>long story short I have no clue how to use core data :/</p>
    <p>then I tried UserDefaults... that didnt work and I don't even know why</p>
    <p>So then I went to GitHub trying to find a CoreData library that did all the hard work for me, and all I had to do was save it.</p>
    <p>well I couldn't find a CoreData library, but what I did find was way greater</p>
    <p>I found a library that made @AppStorage compatible with older versions of SwiftUI</p>
    <p>and two lines of code later, the app was functioning! I'll attach a screenshot of it working when I get home. happy 21st!</p>
