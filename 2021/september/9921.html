    <h1>9+10=21 <br>9/9/21 11:13 AM EST</h1>
    <p>the day is almost here</p>
    <p>9/10/21</p>
    <p>otherwise known as 9+10=21</p>
    <p>unfortunately i won't be able to write an entry on this momentous date because i'ts "fun day" in IE, and i'll probably be going outside.</p>
    <p>despite that, though, 9/10/21 will be a great day for meme culture everywhere. <br>i can already tell it's going to be trending on Twitter as soon as the clock strikes midnight.</p>
    <p>have a good 9/10/21</p
