    <h1>Ok this is kinda weird <br>9/3/21 <b>10:45 AM?!</b></h1>
    <p>yes im aware the time is 10:45 AM.</p>
    <p>so basically today is "free day" in IE, right?</p>
    <p>which means no computers in IE (i think)</p>
    <p>And so remember that one class that I haven't even met my teacher yet></p>
    <p>so today we're in the auditorium,and I finished all my work, so I get to use my school chromebook.</p>
    <p>but not school computers in IE. But hey, im here, im updating the site, thats all that matters</p>
    <p>So remember that watch app I was telling you about (i think) yesterday?</p>
    <p>I realized a bit more information.</p>
    <p>So, to keep track of the time I use Calendar.current(bySettingHour: 7, minute: 10, second 20, of: Date())!</p>
    <p>(and yes, that exclamation mark IS important)</p>
    <p>So the important thing here is "of: Date()". <br>basically, I'm thinking that the reason you have to restart the watch in order for the app to work properly is because of that.</p>
    <p>Let me break it down for you. <br>Basically, Calendar.current(bySettingHour: *hour*, minute: *minute*, second: *second* of: Date()) is adding that time to the sandbox calendar of the app. Now, because of the "of: Date()", it's only adding it to the current day. Meaning,the watch still thinks its the same day even when it's the next day. I'm assuming restarting the watch also resets that sandbox calendar.</p>
    <p>so there really isn't much I can do about that. <br>Normally, I could just make the values reset with an init() statement, but WatchOS 6 doesn't support that, so that's out of the picture. Maybe something in the AppDelegate?</p>
    <p>Anyways, it's almost time to go to 5th period, so cya</p>
    <p>*ps its friday and we dont have school monday so obviously no pages for this weekend and no pages monday L you're gonna have to be patient and wait hahahahahaha LLL hahah lLLL</p
