    <h1>okay uhhhh <br>9/20/21 11:14 AM</h1>
    <p>its been a sec<p>
    <p>Its a long story, so i'll sum it up in one, easy to understand sentence. </p>
    <p>my mom tested positive for covid</p>
    <p>we're all fine now, obviously I'm in school now, but it was kinda frightening at first<p>
    <p>but tbh i think the worst part of it all is the MASSIVE amount of homework to do</p>
    <p>so far i've counted 33 pages of homework that I get to do</p>
    <p>so thats wonderful</p>
    <p>ok im gonna do my work now cya</p>
    <p>oh wait also tomorrow is the 21st night of september <br>and my dad's birthday <br>so thats great</p>
    <p>okay cya now</p>
