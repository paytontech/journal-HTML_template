    <h1>do you remember 21 first night of september <br>9/1/21 11:13 AM</h1>
    <p>just be prepared for me to make that joke on the actual 21st night of september^</p>
    <p>dude this is so weird</p>
    <p>i made a watch app to tell me what period im in, what time it ends, and the teacher (just because)</p>
    <p>and it hasnt been working.</p>
    <p>but all of a sudden, in second period on Monday, IT STARTED WORKING?!</p>
    <p>hold on it gets weirder</p>
    <p>The next day: It STOPS WORKING?! WHAT?!??!?!?!?!???!?!?!?!?!</p>

    <p>Today, also in 2nd period, IT WORKS AGAIN?!</p>
    <p>What is happening.</p>
    <p>I think it could be the (kinda jank) way I did it.</p>
    <p>I don't completely understand <i>exactly</i> what it does, but for the people who know the inner workings of Swift/watchOS, here it is:</p>
    <p>let periodOne = Calendar.current(bySettingHour: 7, minute: 10, second: 0) <br>or something along the lines of that</p>
    <p>so yeah if you're smarter than me, there it is. <br>the person next to me is playing snake so i am too. cya!</p>
