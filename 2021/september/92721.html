    <h1>mmmmmmm <br>9/27/21 11:13 AM</h1>
    <p>i made a useless but interesting discovery</p>
    <p>the school bell rings exactly 23 seconds after the minute, and every week it increases by 1 second. For example, last week was 22 seconds. Literally the most useless discovery ever, but interesting, none the less.</p>
    <p>yesterday i downgraded an iPad for no other reason than nostalgia. It was not worth the 10 minutes I spent on the iPad afterwards.</p>
    <p>Downgrading iOS is hard. You have to deal with shsh blobs, OTA Blobs, and it gets infinitely harder if Apple doesn't sign it anymore.</p>
    <p>And (of course) Apple doesn't sign iOS 6.1.3 anymore.</p>
    <p>It took 3-4 hours to install it - and even better, it probably would've taken 10-20 minutes, had I realized that I hadn't even jailbroken the iPad correctly.</p>
    <p>EVEN BETTER: I couldn't use most of the apps, because iOS 6 doesn't know how to handle the new Apple ID 2FA system, it just throws an incorrect password error</p>
    <p>Do I think it was a waste of time? Yes. <br>Is this completely pointless? Yes. <br>Am I glad I did it? Eh. Sort of.</p>
    <p>it was nice to experience iOS 6 again, after so long. I remember when I first upgraded the iPad to iOS 7, I HATED the new design, as did many others, but I'm used to it now, so I don't mind.</p>
