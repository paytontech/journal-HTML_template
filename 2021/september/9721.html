    <p>Okay so my 4th period ELA teacher (who none of us have met yet) apparently isn't scheduled to be back AT ALL this month. that's right.</p>

    <p>anyways im gonna do some coding now cya</p>
    
    <p>UPDATE 10/27/21: we switched ELA teachers so now I guess i won't meet my original ELA teacher ever :)</p>
