    <p>okay, its not that weird but still</p>
    <p>i got to eat a donut in first period today because i (apparently) sold like 10 things but idk</p>
    <p>kinda feel like getting in the habit of adding CSS to all these sites again, but idk</p>
    <p>might just put one CSS file across all the sites for consistent design across all the sites</p>
    <img src="93021.PNG" alt="hmmmm"/>
    <p>not lookin too good, gonna switch the blue to light blue, and make paragraphs also blue maybe</p>
    <img src="images/949439434.PNG"/>
    <p>idk looks a little too bright</p>
    <p>not too bad</p>
    <p>now we're gonna make regular text white</p>
      <p>they're also bold now, it just looks better. now to apply this to every page</p>
      <p>oh i also need to add a back button for navigation to each page, gonna freshen that up a bit as well</p>
      <p>also im gonna start centering pages, but centering on each page would genuinely take like 30 minutes so for now this is the only entry that's centered</p>
