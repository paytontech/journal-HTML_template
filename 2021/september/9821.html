    <h1>there are no more songs that have the word "September" that i actually know lol <br>9/8/21 11:13 AM</h1>
    <p>wow there really isnt anything to talk about</p>
    <p>basically just normal stuff has happened today</p>
    <p>oh yeah, my science teacher's room is super cold because apparently the school doesn't have enough money to fix it</p>
    <p>this room is also pretty cold</p>
    <p>ouch</p>
    <p>bro my teachers won't grade my work and i dont know why</p>
    <p>i literally turned in one of my assignments yesterday and my teacher still hasn't graded it.</p>
    <p>and then there's ELA which makes sense why one of my assignments wasnt graded because i turned it in last period (literally like 10 minutes ago lol)</p>
    <p>speaking of grades, i saw this one video on YouTube where they fed a bot the script for a bunch of comedy shows, and made it do stand up comedy. and some of the jokes were actually kinda funny</p>
    <p>for example: "I am a microwave. Beep Beep. I dropped out of oven school" or "I wonder how dinosaurs survived without credit cards. I guess they didn't"</p>
    <p>and then there were not funny at all ones like</p>
    <p>"Look at this flag. It is waving. Will I wave back? No." like what?!</p>
    <p>what does that even mean?!</p>
    <p>anyways that concludes today's rant</p>
