    <h1>well this is definitely suspicious <br>9/29/21 11:18 AM</h1>
    <p>uhhhhhhhhh so we don't have buses today</p>
    <p>it's kinda weird</p>
    <p>the school is saying too much bus drivers are sick, but that's simply not the case lol</p>
    <p>according to one of my teachers, the drivers are on strike, which, when I think about it, makes a ton of sense</p>
    <p>1. they get paid close to nothing ($22k/year) <br>2. the kids on the buses are just not good (fights, cursing, bullying, screaming, etc.)<br>and 3. there is no number three. that's it</p>
    <p>so i get to be picked up by my parents, whom which I just got a very ominous and concerning text from my mom.</p>
    <p>it says "Dad is picking you up today!! Look for the big embarrasing sign on the van!!</p>
    <p>so thats great, can't wait to see what he conjured up for me</p>
    <p>i already looked it up, it only takes an hour and a half for me to walk home from school, so that's a sacrifice i'm willing to make</p>
    <p>plus i brought earbuds in the case that I do have to walk home, I can at least listen to some music or a podcast or something lol</p>
    <p>so thats great</p>
    <p>thats like my favorite phrase when something definitely ISN'T great :/</p>
    <p>okay cya</p>
    <div>
      <h1>part 2 <br>still 9/29/21 12:53 PM</h1>
      <p>hello yes here I am in Career Connection on my chromebook</p>
      <p>im kinda bored (i have nothing else to do) so im just gonna add some CSS to these sites. starting with this one</p>
      <p>wow it looks nice</p>
      <p>at least it looks better than whatever New York Times looking font that HTML defaults to.</p>
      <p>im gonna change the colors now</p>
      <p>blue looks fine <i>i guess</i></p>
      <p>lets make headers red</p>
      <p>why does it not look like the worst thing ever</p>
      <p>i have an idea <br> we'll make paragraphs yellow</p>
      <p>wow thats painful</p>
      <p>eh we'll keep it</p>
      <p>gonna make headers aquamarine now</p>
      <p id="pain">nevermind aquamarine wasnt painful enough so theyre "lawngreen"</p>
      <p>okay the period's basically over now so cya tomorrow hopefully probably idk</p>
