        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>you are so incredibly stupid</p>
        <p>why would you even try going to a page that doesn't exist lol</p>
        <p>i mean of course it doesn't show anything, IT DOESN'T EXIST!</p>
        <p>you're lucky i took the time out of my day to make an error page</p>
        <p>because i could've just redirected you to THIS</p>
        <img src="loser.PNG"/>
        <p>BUT NO! I just HAD to take the time out of my day to make this page for you</p>
        <p>and i don't even get a "thank you".</p>
        <p>i am so incredibly disappointed in you.</p>
        <p>anyways please press the button at the top of the screen that says "Navigation" and GET OFF MY LAWN!</p>
        <p>on a serious note, nothing much has happened, but something WILL happen soon.</p>
        <p>and that something that will happen soon (next like 10 minutes) is that I will be moving the website from code.org's editor to maintaining a local copy on VS Code.<p>
          <p>wow cool here we are in VS Code</p>
          <p>whoops there goes the bell cya tomorrow or monday or tuesday</p>
