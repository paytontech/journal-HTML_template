        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>i swear i've used that title like 30 times already</p>
        <p>we have new seats in career connections</p>
        <p>and 2/3 of them i have already talked to before and consider somewhat close friends</p>
        <p>that is a statistic that does not matter at all to the story, but still</p>
        <p>so, typically i have a terrible schedule with cutting my nails - most of the time i just forget to.</p>
        <p>(dont worry btw, i clipped them last night purely because of the story im telling rn)</p>
        <p>so we were talking about how long they were, right?</p>
        <p>and the weirdest, most random thing happens.</p>
        <p>one of the people just out of nowhere says "Are you gay?"</p>
        <p>and i didn't have an answer to that question, so i said my default phrase when i don't have an answer to a question, "Good question."</p>
        <p>so now they probably think i'm questioning my sexuality</p>
        <p>which isn't bad, but still.</p>
        <p>i'd rather nobody think that lol</p>
