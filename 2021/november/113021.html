        <p>i got enough sleep last night and it was great</p>
        <p>i am not at all tired today</p>
        <p>i did not stay up until 2:00 AM watching breaking bad</p>
        <p>life is great</p>
        <p>thinking of making a new website design</p>
        <p>not that much of a new design, really just a new color scheme</p>
        <p>possibly redesigned background</p>
        <p>ok done</p>
        <p>changelog: <br>-new background (GRADIENT!!)<br>-paytondev signing up at the top of the screen (SF ROUNDED!) (+ an awesome shadow)<br>-better navigation button (now darkens when hover/click) (+ another shadow)<br>-title text has shadow (AWESOME!!)</p>
        <p>and then here's what i plan to do: <br>-about website page<br>-more pages<br>-redesigned navigation page (that actually looks good)</p>
        <p>alright, cya!</p>
