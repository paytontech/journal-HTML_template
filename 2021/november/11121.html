        <p>heyyyy so remember that whole mess that happened a couple weeks ago?</p>
        <p>y'know, when the girl's friends came up to me and said she liked me?</p>
        <p>well something MUCH worse happened Friday.</p>
        <p>see, i could probably ignore the first time it happened because it was (probably) a joke.</p>
        <p>this one, however, came DIRECTLY FROM someone</p>
        <p>AND IT'S A DIFFERENT PERSON?!</p>
        <p>so this one, i definitely cannot play this off as just being a funny little joke</p>
        <p>because this came directly from her</p>
        <p>i'm not gonna go too deep in to this one like a did a couple weeks ago, because you all probably get it by now.</p>
        <p>to sum it up, i do not want to date in middle school. it is simply a terrible idea.</p>
        <p>because only a small percentage of relationships ever actually make it out of high school, so it would kinda suck if the person you loved just kinda left you, and i do not want to put myself through that stuff.</p>
        <p>i'd probably start dating in like 10th/11th grade or something, definitely not middle school, though.</p>
        <p>so now, i actually have to figure out a way to tell this girl i do not want to date her.</p>
        <p>and i have to think quick because i have that class in like an hour</p>
        <p>but yeah, cya</p>
