        <p>wow awesome</p>
        <p> i got 3 hours of sleep last night :)</p>
        <p>i was up until like 2:00 AM watching Breaking Bad (great show, btw)</p>
        <p>i'm genuinely so tired that I saw the principal in the hall way today and at first look thought he genuinely looked like Gus (from Breaking Bad, of course)</p>
        <p>i found a way to install stuff on the computers that you probably should not be allowed to download, but the school can theoretically see this entire site (along with literally every file on this entire drive) so i don't really want to talk about it, because they'd just get rid of it.</p>
        <p>i will say that it involves a package manager that you can get on the computers.</p>
        <p>soooooo yeah</p>
        <p>basically anything that is available on this package manager (there's a lot. like, a lot.) you can just install on the computers.</p>
        <p>this actually just gave me an idea: could we get WSL running on these computers?</p>
        <p>probably not. i dont respect the admins at this school very much, but i at least respect them enough to think that they're smarter than that.</p>
        <p>i feel like that's the first thing they should block: WSL.</p>
        <p>idk it might work</p>
        <p>wait now that i think about it, it might ACTUALLY work</p>
        <p>NO WAY WHAT</p>
        <p>IT'S NOT BLOCKED ????</p>
        <p>BRUHHHHH</p>
        <p>HOW HAVE THEY NOT BLOCKED IT??? WHAT???</p>
        <p>ah nevermind lol</p>
        <p>you can run the wsl command in powershell, but installing it requires admin permissions, which i do not have lol</p>
