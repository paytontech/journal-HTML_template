        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>i got like 2 hours of sleep</p>
        <p>anyways</p>
        <p>thanksgiving break starts in 2 days</p>
        <p>why they don't just let us have the full week off, i don't know</p>
        <p>but it's whatever, i expect these next final periods and tomorrow to be pretty calm</p>
        <p>i do however have a science test tomorrow</p>
        <p>which is pretty dumb that the teacher is giving a test a day before break</p>
        <p>i mean, nobody's gonna be focused on the test, they're gonna be focused on break starting soon</p>
        <p>but it's whatever</p>
        <p>uhhhhhhhhhhh</p>
        <p>i've been watching breaking bad lately</p>
        <p>its a good show</p>
        <p>walter is scary but it's whatever</p>
        <p>it feels like every second something bad happens to walter</p>
        <p>either his wife wants a divorce, the police arrest him (for unrelated reasons), or whatver else (there is too much to put here)</p>
        <p>JESSE! THE BELL'S ABOUT TO RING, JESSE. YOU NEED TO STOP WRITING JESSE. THIS IS A BAD JOKE, JESSE!</p>
        <p>goodbye</p>
