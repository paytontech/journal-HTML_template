    <h1>what??? entry on friday?? <br>10/1/21 10:58 AM <br>what??? entry at 10 AM???</h1>
      <b>
        <p>yes i know its weird, but i have nothing else to do in ELA class so i'm here</p>
        <p>oh also no entry in actual I/E because we're going to the gym, which means no computers, which means L</p>
        <p>some dude is literally playing Wii Party on his chromebook in here lol</p>
        <p>these chromebooks have an AMD A6 and 4GB of ram how is that possible</p>
        <p>also the spacebar on mine sucks but that might just be an issue with mine</p>
        <p>bruh the bell is already about to ring :/</p>
        <p>makes sense, I literally started this 11 minutes before the bell is supposed to ring</p>
        <p>i haven't really had the motivation to do coding in a few days, so I'm gonna make some apps or something when I get home</p>
        <p>speaking of home, it's a 3 day weekend so thats nice for me but not for you because that means no entry on monday L</p>
        <p>i wonder how big I can make text here</p>
        <p id="massivetext">WOW!!!!!</p>
        <p>not very</p>
        <p>ok the bell is going to ring in like 3 minutes so cya</p>
