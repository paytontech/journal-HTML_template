        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>you get the drill, im bored in ELA again with nothing to do :/</p>
        <p>the phone got here, it's SUPER nice dude omg</p>
        <p>at first I thought the flat edges would be uncomfortable, but i'd say they're better than the rounded edges</p>
        <p>its got 5G, and also for some reason I can get 5G INSIDE THE HOUSE which is really weird, but appreciated.</p>
        <p>it's got 120hz<br>smaller notch<br>MASSIVE cameras<br>LiDAR<br>5G UltraWideBand<br>Macro cameras + Cinematic mode</p>
        <p>ill try to upload some images here that I took with the macro cameras after school/when I can get a good cell signal to login to iCloud</p>
        <p>its weird because this school just blocks cell signal somehow</p>
        <p>even in the cafeteria, arguably the most open, and window-ful place in the building doesn't get cell service, certainly not 5G</p>
        <p>anyways back to the phone,<br>a lot of people at first (including me) said it wasn't very exciting, and it wasn't that big of an upgrade. And while sure, it wasn't as big of a design change/new feature set as the 12 series was compared to the 11s, but still, it's a MASSIVE improvement, and a MASSIVE camera bump like omg those cameras are HUGE</p>
        <p>the only issue is that i'm dumb, so I didn't order it a case. I did yesterday, and it's supposed to be here tomorrow, but until it gets here im caseless. normally that wouldn't really be an issue, but this phone is SLIPPERY. like, really slippery. Just holding it makes it slip slowly out of my hand lol</p>
        <p>anyways the bell's about to go off soooooooooo cya in like 5 minutes lol</p>
        <h1>well good for you you look happy and healthy<br>10/7/21 11:16 AM</h1>
        <p>ok the weirdest thing happened in one of my classes today</p>
        <p>not gonna say what period or teacher because im not gonna snitch because the school can definitely very much see these</p>
        <p>but basically we were working on something, and the teacher puts on music.</p>
        <p>it was a playlist with a bunch of music in it and stuff that they found on the front page of whatever music service they used (not saying which one, because once again, the school admins are a bunch of rats)</p>
        <p>and in that playlist was: <br>Industry Baby - Lil Nas X<br>Montero (Call Me By Your Name) - Also Lil Nas X<br>Good 4 U - Olivia Rodrigo<br>Kiss Me More - Doja Cat<br>Stay - that one kid and justin bieber<br>Deja Vu - Also Olivia Rodrigo<br>and these were ALL UNCENSORED LMAOOOOOO</p>
        <p>and they did not care one bit, they just turned down the speakers slightly and KEPT LISTENING TO THEM?!?!?!?!?!</p>
        <p>i mean, im not complaining, some of these are pretty good songs, it's just that they were all uncensored, and very full of curse words lol</p>
        <p>still cant get service in here so im just gonna have to add the macro shots when I get home if i remember</p>
        <p>in the meantime, heres some iPhone 13 macro shots I found online</p>
