        <p>so far nothing exciting has happened today</p>
        <p>which is the SAME THING I said yesterday :(</p>
        <p>i mean i hacked my nintendo switch last night, but that's about it</p>
        <p>couldn't even get it to do the specific thing I wanted to do.</p>
        <p>literally EVERYTHING that I could do was there except for that one thing i needed to do.</p>
        <p>kinda sucks but i'm gonna try to get it working when i get home</p>
        <p>apparently tonight is trick or treating for some neighborhoods. why specifically tonight? no clue! but it is</p>
        <p>just updated the site so that the navigation button stays at the top of the screen forever</p>
