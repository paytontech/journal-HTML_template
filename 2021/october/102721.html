        <p>nothing exciting has happened so far today :(</p>
        <p>kinda a normal day overall</p>
        <p>i found a pretty massive exploit to let you do literally ANYTHING AT ALL on the school chromebooks, but the school can very definitely see this, and i, for obvious reasons, won't say what the exploit is until I do some more experimenting.</p>
        <p>like i have no idea how the school hasn't blocked it yet, it's super easy to do, sooooooooo</p>
        <p>its also super easy to block so</p>
        <p>uhhhh</p>
        <p>there's also a way to run any website on these chromebooks, which has definitely been discovered, and definitely been blocked, and has definitely had many workarounds for the block.</p>
        <p>basically, just google the name of the blocked website that you want to go to, get the page source for the google page, then paste it into a live HTML editor. like I said, super easy</p>
        <p>the school has blocked a LOT of the HTML Editor websites, buuuuuut not all of them.</p>
        <p>i've been thinking of doing something lately</p>
        <p>Basically all of the Remote Desktop & Game Streaming clients have been blocked on the school's network, for obvious reasons.</p>
        <p>so what I was thinking is... <br>I program my own Remote Desktop client, and host it on a website. I fully expect the school to block said domain, so this is where phase B comes in</p>
        <p>the moment the school blocks the one domain, I just host the website on like 20 different domains, buying more each few weeks.</p>
        <p>"Oh, but domain names are like $40!!! How are you gonna get the money for 20 OF THEM?!?!?!?!" im glad you asked</p>
        <p>that's where NameCheap comes in</p>
        <p>namecheap only charges like $1-$5/year for domain names, and i bet they'd charge EVEN LESS if it's just a bunch of random letters and numbers</p>
        <p>and I would host them using my own computer(s), not some $200/year DNS hosting service</p>
        <p>so yeah, super easy.</p>
        <p>i plan on writing the client this weekend, and then when i'm done, i'll get the domains, set up DNS, web hosting, etc.</p>
        <p>and then, i'd (hopefully) have multiple backup remote desktop clients, in case one ever gets blocked.</p>
