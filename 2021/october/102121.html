        <p>what</p>
        <p>so much happened yesterday afternoon</p>
        <p>this one girl's friend came up to me and said she liked me</p>
        <p>and like, not to offend anyone (i have no clue how this could be offensive), but I don't really want to date anyone in middle school</p>
        <p>it's basically just asking for trouble</p>
        <p>im REALLY hoping it was just a joke, because i definitely don't have the confidence to just go "haha L loser hahahahah i dont like you back ahahahaha"</p>
        <p>for real though, i dont want to say no, because i'd feel bad, but i dont want to say yes, because dating someone while in middle school is a terrible idea</p>
        <p>especially when you dont want to date said person</p>
        <p>idk what to do man</p>
        <p>i obviously cant just ignore it - or maybe I can? if it was a joke??</p>
        <p>and like, i have no clue if it was a joke or not, i dont know what to do</p>
        <p><i>maybe</i> a misunderstanding???</p>
        <p>but thats pretty unlikely but stillllllllllll</p>
        <p>this isn't the first time it's happened ever, but its the first time its happened with a girl</p>
        <p>but that's besides the point</p>
        <p>im thinking way too much in to what is probably (hopefully) a joke</p>
        <p>im probably gonna talk to my friends at lunch next period and see what they think</p>
        <p>my current plan is, if it does come up again today, i'll probably address it, but if it doesnt come up in conversation or something, i wont mention it.</p>
        <p>anyways, my moms going to Las Vegas today</p>
        <p>she's flying Spirit though, so maybe she won't be coming back</p>
        <p>oh, also one of my guinea pigs just kinda DIED a few days ago</p>
        <p>it kinda sucks tbh, he was one of my favorites.</p>
        <p>but hopefully his soul will live on in whichever incineration plant he's probably at right now</p>
        <p>no but imagine he actually isnt dead, and we basically bagged him up and threw him in the garbage</p>
        <p>if he was somehow alive, he definitely isn't anymore</p>
        <p>im just kinda thinking about the whole situation</p>
        <p>this is so weird for me, because i have like 6 friends in this entire school</p>
        <p>ive never had something like this happen before - with a girl</p>
        <p>and plus i dont even know if i like girls in general - still trying to get that figured out</p>
        <p>everything right now is just kinda a mess</p>
        <p>and the thing is - i had a crush on HER at one point like 4 years ago</p>
        <p>who knew it would be so hard trying to figure out if you want to date a previous crush</p>
        <p>man, love sucks :/</p>
        <p>who knew basically my entire week could be almost ruined because a girl said she liked me</p>
        <p>for most people - that would make their entire year</p>
        <p>but not me - because like i said before, dating in middle school is pretty dumb</p>
        <p>i simply cannot get my mind off this</p>
        <p>i dont wanna say no though, because i'd feel bad for the rest of my life, but i dont wanna say yes, because even if i DID want to date in middle school, i already have so much stuff to do, like coding, homework, producing content, keeping friendships going, and taking care of pets and famile - i simply have too much stuff to do.</p>
        <p>and adding one more thing to that list would probably change my life for the worse, like rushing out homework, apps, and content, not socializing with friends and possibly losing them, pets being sad, it's just too much for me to handle.</p>
        <p>and PLUS there's (supposedly) another girl who likes me, but ive chosen to ignore it, and now I feel bad for ignoring it. i cant really keep living a life based on just ignoring stuff that I dont want to happen - because eventually, its all going to catch up to me.</p>
        <p>okay, the bell is going to ring here in a few minutes. I'll update with what happens later.</p>
