        <p>it's like 40 degrees out today what</p>
        <p>it was a perfectly normal temperature yesterday, but now it's just painful</p>
        <p>and the fact that this room is also cold isn't really helping much either.</p>
        <p>i tried out a new web development thing called codepen.io. It's super easy to use, and I'm thinking of just doing this on there from now on.</p>
        <p>the only issue with that is that for some reason my teacher disabled downloading all the files at a time, so i'd need to go by, one by one, downloading the files, which would be pretty painful.</p>
