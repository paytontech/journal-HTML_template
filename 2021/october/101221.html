        <p>bruh</p>
        <p>ignore the title, it is a complete lie.</p>
        <p>the teacher (who i'm definitely going to throw under the bus here) that I have 3rd period science, every morning goes around and checks everyone's homework, as a normal teacher does. Of course, some kids can't find it in their millions of other papers they have stored. So she goes around, checks everyone's homework, then some kids find their papers as the teacher finishes going around. So, naturally, they tell her "hey I found my paper", and she says "oh, go turn it in. It'll still be counted as late though, and for half credit". SHE GAVE THESE KIDS AN F, ONLY BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO SHOW IT TO HER AS SHE WAS GOING AROUND TO CHECK IT. Keep in mind, they turned it in ON the due date, and fully completed, but still. It's "late". this school sucks :/</p>
