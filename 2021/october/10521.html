      <h1>back here in ELA 4th period again<br>10/5/21 10:15 AM</h1>
      <b>
        <p>wow wait what 4th period AGAIN?! <br>yes, i am bored with nothing to do AGAIN!!</p>
        <p>ill also be writing in 5th period, so this should be a long page</p>
        <p>i have no idea what to do</p>
        <p>i ordered a new phone, so that's great</p>
        <p>it's not here yet, but it's supposed to be here tomorrow</p>
        <p>its kinda a long story as to why, originally I wasn't gonna be able to upgrade until January</p>
        <p>so basically, my mom's phone broke to the point where she will literally get glass shards in her fingers if she tries to use it.</p>
        <p>originally we were just gonna order the parts from iFixit, and I would fix it for her.</p>
        <p>BUT the iFixit iPhone 11 Screen Replacement kit was about the same price it would cost to pay off my phone and upgrade.</p>
        <p>i think you can see where this is going</p>
        <p>the thing is, there were way more things wrong with her phone than the screen, for example: the speakers, cameras, etc.</p>
        <p>and to get all that replaced would cost WAY more than just paying off my old phone, me upgrading, and just giving my old (pretty good condition - like new) phone to her</p>
        <p>so, that's exactly what we did.</p>
        <p>(supposedly) on Wednesday, October 6th by 7:00 PM, I will be a proud owner of a brand new iPhone 13 Pro (256 GB, Verizon)</p>
        <p>however, if you check the Verizon website, you may notice that the iPhone 13 Pro says "this item is on backorder and will not ship until October 22nd"</p>
        <p>so, you may be wondering how mine is coming October 6th. And the answer is: I DONT KNOW!</p>
        <p>The only thing I can really think of is that we ordered the phone with the help of a Verizon Live Chat Representative, who, I'm assuming, pulled some strings for us behind the scenes to get us the phone VERY early.</p>
        <p>Literally every vendor (including Apple themselves) is out of iPhone 13 Pros, and I just happened to get one within a VERY reasonable delivery date. Apple has delivery dates going as far back as NOVEMBER! And I'm getting mine super early, which I'm very greatful for, and I'm sure my mom is too. Because if we had ordered it online, and waited until the 22nd for it to ship, my mom wouldn't be there to get her phone, because she is leaving for a trip on the 21st.</p>
        <p>alright I think that's the end of my rambling about my phone shipping date, and the end of me editing this site for now, see ya in 5th period probably</p>
