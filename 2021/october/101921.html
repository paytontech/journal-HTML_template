        <p>ummmmm sooo a LOT has happened since yesterday</p>
        <p>so apparently this one kid did drugs or something in the bathroom</p>
        <p>and <i>apparently </i>they've been doing this for a while now</p>
        <p>and <i>also apparently </i>someone found their stash behind the bleachers, (i think) in the gym.</p>
        <p>again, none of this has been confirmed by any staff or police, but considering this person's confirmed track history, this may be worth talking about and MIGHT be real</p>
        <p>they also have a rumored history of some things WORSE than doing drugs in the bathroom, but I am really not at all comfortable talking about that here, just think of some things worse than being a minor and doing drugs at school, and one of the things you can think of is probably true</p>
        <p>not gonna say their name or anything for obvious reasons.</p>
        <p>but yeah</p>
        <p>i haven't really seen them anywhere around the school lately, which <i>may </i> "confirm" the rumors, maybe they got expelled or something.</p>
        <p>but again, like I said, most of this stuff is just allegations, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>
        <p>i've decided that i'm not gonna move the site to codepen, because their "Projects" feature requires the starter subscription, which costs $9/month.</p>
