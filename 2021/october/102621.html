        <p>ok, reason there was nothing friday, obvious reasons, we were in the gym. nothing yesterday: sick</p>
        <p>but anyways</p>
        <p>friday was kind of a crappy day for me tbh</p>
        <p>im starting to get allergies again, which is just even worse with a mask on.</p>
        <p>at this point, my nose has gotten so bad, that i basically need to keep my mouth open 24/7 or i'll just suffocate to death :/</p>
        <p>but it was even worse on friday</p>
        <p>because i was super tired, had a runny nose, and it was the end of the week and i was super excited to just collapse in my bed and sleep for the next 2 days straight.</p>
        <p>but yeah</p>
        <p>it's starting to get super cold now here</p>
        <p>it's like 45-48 farenheight right now i think</p>
        <p>i definitely did not spell that right but frankly i just dont care</p>
        <p>4th period is honestly my least favorite class</p>
        <p>it literally lasts 2 periods</p>
        <p>and its right before IE (my favorite class)</p>
        <p>BUT i had to switch teachers and rooms for 4th period because my teacher hadn't shown up yet all year</p>
        <p>and why did i say it like its a good thing?, you ask.</p>
        <p>WELL, the room is literally the first classroom in the hall, right next to the stairs, so i get to be one of the first people in 4th period.</p>
        <p>also its just really nice not having to be on the stairs for 30 minutes because literally everyone is also on the stairs, and slow.</p>
        <p>typically its just me and like 5 other people there</p>
        <p>its pretty nice</p>
