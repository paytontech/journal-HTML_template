        <p>nothing exciting has happened today</p>
        <p>like, nothing at all</p>
        <p>the end of the quarter is friday, and im pretty okay with my grades</p>
        <p>mostly a's and b's</p>
        <p>im trying to make an app that can solve word searches, but that's not working too well.</p>
        <p>it's definitely VERY possible, but Apple's Vision framework is very difficult to configure and has very poor documentation.</p>
