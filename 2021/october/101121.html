        <p>i think im gonna start doing this thing where I just don't correct spelling mistakes or typos, starting niw</p>
        <p>apparently I had 3 rapidly guessed questions which is great</p>
        <p>if you get like more than 5 it stops the test, so im kinda glad that didnt happen to me lol</p>

        <h1>WHATTT??????????<br>10/11/21 11:15 AM</h1>
        <p>LMAOOOOOOO so there's this kid in my science and IE class who does nothing but use Discord on his Chromebook (which is definitely NOT allowed, btw)</p>
        <p>and I think he just got CAUGHT!</p>
        <p>We were walking into I/E class and a (i think) guidance councelor yelled "[KID'S NAME]." and told him to talk to her</p>
        <p>I couldn't hear anything about what they were saying, but I saw the tech teacher with the kids chromebook in his hand, looking at it disapprovingly, and the kid was shaking.</p>
        <p>we also caught him doing some infinitely worse things than just using Discord on his chromebook, but I'm not really allowed to go in to detail about that.</p>
