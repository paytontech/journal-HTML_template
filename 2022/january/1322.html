      <h1>quick lil update on the whole covid thing<br>1/3/22, 12:20 PM (HOME)</h1>
      <b>
        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>hello again</p>
        <p>so far nothing has happened, nor do I expect anything to happen (yet)</p>
        <p>so as of right now, we are still in-person, and I expect it to stay like that for the rest of this week at least.</p>
        <p>HOWEVER, there is a board meeting later this week where I (and a ton of other people) expect them to address the whole covid thing.</p>
        <p>Again, this isn't confirmed yet, but people are thinking we're gonna go virtual (or at least hybrid learning)</p>
        <p>I don't know if I entirely believe this tbh, because that would require a ton of students to be out, and where the school is based, there is not much covid cases</p>
        <p>I really only expect them to start requiring masks again, as many health professionals in our area have requested that.</p>
        <p>But again, if the worst happens and we do go virtual, I will continue to write here.</p>
        <p>I will also update this page if we find out about anything.</p>
        <p>anyways, that's it. goodbye for now!</p>
        <h1>UPDATE 1</h1>
        <p>school pushed a cool little thing</p>
        <p>basically sent out a letter to parents saying basically everything we've already known</p>
        <p>so nothing new</p>
        <p>they don't even require masks, they're still just a recommendation <i>even for unvaccinated people</i></p>
        <p>like what</p>
        <p>anyways cya tomorrow i guess</p>
