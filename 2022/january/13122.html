        <p>but its probably far too late to change class</p>
        <p>since i have nothing else to say i'll just let github copilot finish this</p>

        <p>alright hello i am back</p>
        <p>i dont know if ive complained about this before here but im gonna do it anyway</p>
        <p>this keyboard is actually so annoying to type on</p>
        <p>and its all because of one issue</p>
        <p>in order to actuate the spacebar, you need to press directly in the center</p>
        <p>for it to even work</p>
        <p>hitting it on the left or right sides do nothing</p>
        <p>just the center</p>
        <p>but yeah</p>
        <p>gonna go work on my tech project now</p>
        <p>goodbye</p>
