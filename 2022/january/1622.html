      <h1>TODAYS THE DAY<br>1/6/22, 8:36 AM</h1>
      <b>
        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>the board meeting is today</p>
        <p>this is the day we find out if we're going virtual or not</p>
        <p>The day we find out everything</p>
        <p>Of course we probably won't find out today</p>
        <p>We'll probably find out tomorrow, or at least very late today</p>
        <p>but still, they're deciding today, and that's all that matters</p>
        <p>So yeah</p>
        <p>I guess we'll find out via a letter on the school's website</p>
        <p>pretty exciting</p>
        <p>at first i didn't really care if we went virtual or not, but now i'm kinda leaning towards wanting to go virtual</p>
        <p>i typically wake up at 5 AM for school, and during virtual that was bumped up to 7 AM</p>
        <p>sure, my grades will plummet, but i think its worth it for that extra 2 hours of sleep</p>
        <p>I guess i'll keep you all updated</p>
        <p>update 11:37 AM: no update yet</p>
        <p>there isnt even a time on the website</p>
        <p>All I know about it is that it is supposedly happening today</p>
        <p>I guess we'll see</p>
        <p>OK then</p>
        <p>gonna do some changes to the site real quick</p>
        <p>goodbye</p>
        <h1>1:20 PM EST</h1>
        <p>no update yet unfortunately</p>
        <p>i'm pretty sure they do meetings at 4-6 PM so sometime around there we might get an update</p>
        <p>of course, I will update this later with info about it but yeah</p>
        <p>i actually just thought of something</p>
        <p>the parent letter calls this meeting a "Special Board Meeting"</p>
        <p>this means it isn't a regular one</p>
        <p>meaning that they thought there was a big enough threat from covid to call this meeting</p>
        <p>they also started cleaning literally everything (assuming its in preperation for going virtual!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!)</p>
        <p>so yeah thats uhhh</p>
        <p>possibly going virtual again. wow</p>
        <p>at first i thought it wasnt gonna happen, but there is actually a considerable chance of it happening</p>
        <p>wow</p>
        <p>i honestly want to go virtual (purely because of the extra 2 hours of sleep i'd probably get)</p>
        <p>then again, my grades would go way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way down so</p>
        <p>but uhhhh</p>
        <p>i really dont know</p>
        <p>oh also i changed the fonts so yeah neat awesome cool wow</p>
        <p>HELLO I AM TYPING THIS ON MY PHONE 2:20 PM</p>
        <p>The vscode.dev client for iPhone (not surprisingly) sucks</p>
        <p>anyways thats not the point of me writing this</p>
        <p>WE HAVE AN UPDATE</p>
        <p>MY BUS DRIVER HEARS THAT THERE WILL BE CHANGES</p>
        <p>what kind of changes, you ask?</p>
        <p>No clue, that is all she will say</p>
        <p>anyways im gonna get off this mobile vscode web client now goodbye</p>
