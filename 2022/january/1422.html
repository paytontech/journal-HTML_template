        <p>WE ARE IN THE SCHOOL</p>
        <p>(for the time being)</p>
        <p>my friend's school which is pretty close to this one recently closed for today and tomorrow to discuss going virtual</p>
        <p>the chances are high that we are going virtual</p>
        <p>and tbh i dont really have a problem with going virtual</p>
        <p>but i also dont actively WANT to go virtual</p>
        <p>im neutral on the situation</p>
        <p>there are several cons, but there are also several pros</p>
        <p>so yeah</p>
        <p>goodbye</p>
        <h1>back again here i am wow<br>1/4/21, 1:40 PM</h1>
        <p>uhhh so we may actually be going virtual</p>
        <p>teachers are talking about how the admins are being more strict with covid rules</p>
        <p>and some teachers are purposefully doing lessons that are easy to do "if we do go virtual"</p>
        <p>they are literally PREPARING to go virtual</p>
        <p>this is not a good sign!</p>
        <p>i have a small <i>sus</i>picion that we are going virtual</p>
        <p>so uhh</p>
        <p>oh and another thing</p>
        <p>there is barely anyone here today</p>
        <p>like nobody is here</p>
        <p>that may influence their decision on the 6th for the board meeting</p>
        <p>so anyways i just realized that i forgot to talk about break at all</p>
        <p>first off, i wasnt here on friday because my mom was worried about all the threats happening and called me in sick</p>
        <p>on friday i went to an escape room for my birthday and it turns out that my mom unknowingly chose the hardest difficulty possible</p>
        <p>although we did surprisingly get pretty far</p>
        <p>but yeah next time we do an escape room we will hopefully NOT choose literally the hardest mode</p>
        <p>ok then i have some assignments to do now so goodbye i guess !</p>
