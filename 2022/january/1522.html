        <p>I got more sleep tonight than i did the night before yet somehow i am even more tired today!</p>
        <p>dont quite know how that works but okay</p>
        <p>i dont know if i already mentioned this here but the site is now connected to its own domain (<a href="http://www.paytondev.xyz">paytondev.xyz</a>) so thats pretty cool</p>
        <p>yeah</p>
        <p>it is somewhat more likely that the school is going to go virtual</p>
        <p>there are a ton of kids (and even teachers) out because of covid right now and its just overall a mess</p>
        <p>i am not sure if i should be worried about this or not</p>
        <p>i probably should</p>
        <p>anyways</p>
        <p>im outta here</p>
