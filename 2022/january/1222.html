        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>ok hello</p>
        <p>school starts (supposedly) in 2 days</p>
        <p>the reason I say supposedly is because there is a chance that we're going VIRTUAL.</p>
        <p>which would not be good (for multiple reasons)</p>
        <p>so if the worst happens and we do go virtual, I just want everyone out there to know that i will continue to update this site daily</p>
        <p>although instead of being around the same time (typically 11:13 AM), it would be at varying time purely because i do not have a consistent schedule</p>
        <p>so i will update this site daily</p>
        <p>just at differing times</p>
        <p>so yeah</p>
        <p>just a quick lil update</p>
        <p>cya (hopefully) on the 4th!</p>
