        <p>But Payton, what are you doing up at 2 AM on a school night?!</p>
        <p>Uhhh so heres the little funny lil thing</p>
        <p>I do not have school tomorrow</p>
        <p>or I guess today depending on how you look at it</p>
        <p>I personally don't count it tomorrow until I have fallen asleep and woken up or the sun rises</p>
        <p>So anyways I tested positive for COVID-19</p>
        <p>(really makes ya think about the schools covid protocols)</p>
        <p>started feeling symptoms wednesday, so with the 5 day thing that would mean I should be back tomorrow/today, right?</p>
        <p>Thats what we thought at first (and if it had been that way, I wouldn't have even missed any school because school was canceled on Tuesday)</p>
        <p>But uhhh it turns out it starts a day after you test positive</p>
        <p>So i'll be in here for another 2 days (not counting the 4 i've already stayed in here)</p>
        <p>So yeah just a quick little update, see ya all on Friday (supposedly)</p>
