        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>I don't have any good titles for these anymore</p>
        <p>they're all either "hello" or "back again" or "HERE WE ARE" or sometimes just "bruh"</p>
        <p>i need to get more creative with these names</p>
        <p>anyways hello</p>
        <p>i made a <a href="https://github.com/paytontech/paytontech.github.io/blob/master/TODO.md">todo list</a> for this site</p>
        <p>i kinda wanna redesign it because I don't think the gradient doesn't really look good anymore</p>
        <p>but i dont know what to change the background to</p>
        <p>maybe a brighter gradient/a different colored gradient</p>
        <p>i'll try experimenting with a nice pastel green</p>
        <p>hopefully that looks better</p>
        <p>unfortunately im on vscode for the web and so i cannot preview it right now</p>
        <p>im just gonna commit it</p>
        <p>whats the worst that could happen?</p>
        <p>hmmm</p>
        <p>idk</p>
        <p>it doesnt look bad but it also doesn't look especially good</p>
        <p>I do like how the color gets kinda darker in the middle to showcase the contents of the page</p>
        <p>Ok i slightly modified it lets see how/if it works</p>
        <p>just changed the thing DRASTICALLY and it is wonderful</p>
        <p>just wonderful</p>
        <p>I actually really enjoy it like this</p>
        <p>I like how the headers on navigation have a blue shadow that kinda makes them look like they're glowing</p>
        <p>its just overall great</p>
        <p>so yeah</p>
        <p>uhhhh cya later i guess</p>
        <p>ive had an idea</p>
        <p>we should do a dark and light mode</p>
        <p>gonna do that now</p>
        <p>alright the basics for dark mode are in an should be working</p>
        <p>but what about devices that don't have a dark mode option?</p>
        <p>i wanna add a toggle dark mode button for those people</p>
        <p>so im gonna do that</p>
        <p>maybe got it working</p>
        <p>if not that would be sad but whatever</p>
        <p>ok i cannot get toggleable darkmode running properly so im just gonna stick to OS based dark mode</p>
        <p>i'll keep experimenting a bit but dont get excited</p>
        <p>just gonna default it to dark mode so nobody gets mad at me</p>
