        <p>hello</p>
        <p>as you may know, i added some JS to the website to automatically set the title of the page</p>
        <p>it has not been working unforunately, but i think i fixed it</p>
        <p>simply because i forgot to put a slash before defining title.js</p>
        <p>basically, without the slash, it was trying to find a file called title.js in the /2022/january directory</p>
        <p>when the file is at the root of the project (the root basically means that it is not in any folders)</p>
        <p>so i added the slash to the template, and it should (keyword: should) work now!</p>
        <p>let me know if it worked</p>
        <p>alright then</p>
        <p>cya</p>
        <p>IT WORKED</p>
        <p>ok bye</p>
