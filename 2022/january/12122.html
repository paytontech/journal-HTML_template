        <p>I AM BACK HERE</p>
        <p>I am also in a new class</p>
        <p>Instead of STEM, i'm in tech now</p>
        <p>so yeah</p>
        <p>today was "SEL Day"</p>
        <p>SEL stands for Student Emotional Learning (at least I think it does idk)</p>
        <p>basically we do nothing and learn about bullying and stuff</p>
        <p>i kinda like how my first day back from being sick is a day where i dont have to really do anything</p>
        <p>because i did NOT do very much work while i was sick</p>
        <p>so now i get to finish it all this weekend</p>
        <p>even though realistically im not going to get any of it done and im going to stay in bed all day</p>
        <p>but its fine</p>
        <p>alrighty then goodbye</p>
