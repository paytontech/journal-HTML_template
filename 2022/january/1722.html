        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>Ok so we have a small lil update here (also yes i am writing this at home)</p>
        <p>The school called in a 2 hour delay</p>
        <p>Now this doesn't seem much, and it didn't seem much when we got the text about it</p>
        <p><i>Until we got the call about it</i></p>
        <p>The school is delayed for <i>two </i>reasons</p>
        <p>1. The cold (understandable)</p>
        <p>2. SHORT STAFFED?!</p>
        <p>Now fellas, I don't think this is a sign or anything, but it's a sign</p>
        <p>I think the school is going to go virtual (or at least hybrid)</p>
        <p>Anyways, I'll update this later with any updates I get</p>
        <p>UPDATE: Starting Monday there will be a mask requirement</p>
        <p>which kinda means that virtual is not happening (but who knows)</p>
        <p>hybird is still on the table though</p>
        <p>they say an email will be sent out later today so i'll update this once i get it !</p>
        <h1>10:30 AM</h1>
        <p>hello i have some free time so i am going to fix up the website a bit i guess</p>
        <p>i really need to find a way to get the version number working, because its getting kinda annoying changing one thing on the site and then having to check to see if github pages updated it yet</p>
        <p>the only issue is that i need to get it synced up to a server somewhere to get the version ID working, and that may not be possible on a chromebook</p>
        <p>unless i set up a nodejs server somewhere</p>
        <p>alright it doesn't seem to be working unfortunately</p>
        <p>i'll work on getting a server going when I get home, unless I can find an online server provider (for free of course)</p>
        <p>nevermind i just realized what i did wrong</p>
        <h1>UHHH HELLO !!! <br>1/11/22 7:17 PM (HOME)</h1>
        <p>Ok hello</p>
        <p>I've been sick so yeah</p>
        <p>I'll be back tomorrow though</p>
        <p>So we are not going virtual or hybrid</p>
        <p>Universal masking has been confirmed</p>
        <p>And the school plans to keep schools open (unless covid gets worse), "Our goal since the beginning of the pandemic has been to keep the
          schools open and in-person, and that's what we're going to continue to do."</p>
        <p>Wait what</p>
        <p>"A letter to families from Dr.*********** regarding High School safety check"</p>
        <p>what happened</p>
        <p>Oh its just a drug sweep</p>
        <p>Fair enough</p>
        <p>There's ANOTHER one???</p>
        <p>Oh wait its just talking about the drug sweep</p>
        <p>Ok then</p>
        <p>Well</p>
        <p>cya tomorrow i guess</p>
