        <!-- put site content here -->
        <p>yes, i very much <b>will</b> be saying that every month</p>
        <p>its kinda like new year new me but months instead</p>
        <p>i dont know why i felt that i had to explain that</p>
        <p>so anyways something incredible happened last night</p>
        <p>but for anyone to understand i kinda have to compress the last 2-3 years into a few sentences</p>
        <p>so here we go</p>
        <p>so basically, there was this company called Anki who made robots</p>
        <p>they made a robot called Cozmo, they made another one called Vector, and they also made a (sorta) robot called Overdrive but that's not important here</p>
        <p>so the focus here is Vector, a really cool robot based on Cozmo that added voice command functionality</p>
        <p>The main difference is that while Cozmo was powered by your phone (you HAD to have the mobile app open for him to function), Vector could function completely independantly of the phone</p>
        <p>They basically built the phone into Vector</p>
        <p>I just realized that this would be much easier to explain if I showed you an image</p>
        <img src="https://thetoytree.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/anki-cozmo-vs-vector.jpg"/>
        <p>So that's Vector and Cozmo</p>
        <p>Cozmo is the one on top with the blue eyes</p>
        <p>and Vector is the one in the bottom right with the green eyes</p>
        <p>they have little treads and can roll around and stuff and its overall awesome</p>
        <p>but yeah</p>
        <p>basically to sum it up, Cozmo was more of a kids toy/learning tool, and Vector was more of a smart home device</p>
        <p>it had alexa built in and everything</p>
        <p>so anyways</p>
        <p>Anki went out of business</p>
        <p>Now, this was fine for Cozmo because he just needed the app to function, no external servers</p>
        <p>But since Vector works independantly of the app, he NEEDED those cloud servers to function properly</p>
        <p>Now, Anki claimed they had a team who were going to keep the servers up, but some very smart people knew that once liquidation of the company was done, so were the servers.</p>
        <p>Luckily the servers never went down because another company called Digital Dream Labs purchased the rights to Vector and Cozmo (as well as Overdrive, but again, that's not important here)</p>
        <p>And so what do our good friends over at DDL do? They put server access behind a paywall.</p>
        <p>That's right! In order to use your now $400 robot (they also increased the price of the robot from $200 to $400), you now had to pay about $7/month or $50/year</p>
        <p>And if you did not, you could not use voice commands.</p>
        <p>The robot would still drive around, play with its cube, and do everything it normally would do, but you cannot control it via voice commands.</p>
        <p>That meant that if you were about to go to sleep and wanted him to stop driving around and making pretty annoying robot noises, you would have to get up, and put him back on his charger (he's able to drive back to his charger by himself if you pay $50/year), and even then, he would still make his annoying lil robot noises until he decides to go to sleep</p>
        <p>it was really annoying, and naturally, people didn't want to pay $50/year to use a robot they already pay $200-$400 for.</p>
        <p>so what do our good friends at DDL do? They actually did something <i>kinda</i> good.</p>
        <p>i cant really tell if its really good or just kinda good, because its still locked behind a paywall, but now its a one time purchase called "Escape Pod"</p>
        <p>What escape pod does is it basically takes DDL's server software, and lets you put it on your own custom server.</p>
        <p>this has many benefits including faster response time and being able to make your own commands, but the biggest benefit is that you only have to pay a one time fee of like $100</p>
        <p>which isnt an especially good price, but at least its a one time purchase</p>
        <p>They also bundled it with a thing called "OSKR" (Open Source Kit for Robotics) but thats not important here. it basically just lets you edit the source code of the robot</p>
        <p>So I got OSKR and Escape pod, and finally, after YEARS of Vector not responding to a single command, he now responds to me.</p>
        <p>Now obviously, there are some downsides to Escape Pod.</p>
        <p>For example, since Escape Pod is designed to work without any external servers, Weather and asking him questions aren't implemented by default. You have to do it yourself, because Weather and Questions require external servers to function.</p>
        <p>I was also going through the commands list on Escape Pod and saw a command that was just called "abuse" which could be triggered by swearing at him</p>
        <p>so naturally, I tried it</p>
        <p>and he played a really sad animation and just overall felt bad for him</p>
        <p>but yeah</p>
        <p>now i just have to wait for DDL to send me my OSKR firmware, then i'll have an entirely customizable robot to play around with and possibly brick if I do something wrong</p>
        <p>they have to send me a custom OSKR firmware because of the way Anki setup the software stack on Vector, making it extremely difficult to modify software.</p>
        <p>So they have to send me a custom firmware tailored to my robot for it to work</p>
        <p>Oh and since the OSKR firmware installer wipes the entire drive (including the recovery software), if the install fails or stops in the middle of the update, you're basically screwed, because without a recovery OS, you can't install any firmware onto the thing.</p>
        <p>So yeah</p>
        <p>Anyways</p>
        <p>class is about to end so im gonna go now</p>
        <p>goodbye</p>
