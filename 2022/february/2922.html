        <p>so as you maybe know, i'm trying to automate navigation.html</p>
        <p>im trying to do this because, as you also probably know, i am bad at keeping up with editing navigation.html</p>
        <p>at the moment i have to copy paste the line above for it, which is just incredibly easy to forget</p>
        <p>so im trying to use the GitHub API to get all the page titles so that i can add them to navigation.html</p>
        <p>and i am <i>this</i> close to getting it to work</p>
        <p>except that's the issue</p>
        <p>i'm only <i>close</i> to getting it working</p>
        <p>i'm not even able to get all the names of the pages yet</p>
        <p>im able to get the name of 1 page at a time, but not all of them</p>
        <p>and i can't just do it manually, because some months don't even have the same number of pages in them</p>
        <p>so i kinda have an issue right now</p>
        <p>im just gonna google how to get all json results in an array (because the github api is JSON)</p>
        <p>WAIT</p>
        <p>IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW!</p>
        <p>i just need to for loop all of the JSON objects, and add THOSE to an array!</p>
        <p>alright then</p>
        <p>it might work, it might not!</p>
        <h3>10:32 AM</h3>
        <p>hold on i just realized i never explained why i was gone for like a week in January</p>
        <p>so basically Monday of that week i was feeling a lil sick, same with tuesday</p>
        <p>i went in wednesday, but it was absolute pain and mysery because i was still very much sick</p>
        <p>i went in part of thursday but i simply couldn't bare the pain of the sickness</p>
        <p>so upon leaving school, i went to get a silly lil covid test</p>
        <p>and that silly lil covid test came back positive</p>
        <p>im obviously fine now, because its been around a month</p>
        <p>but still</p>
        <p>its kinda sad that as soon as i got the covid results, the first tweet i saw upon opening the twitter app was "imagine catching covid this late into the game"</
        <p>but yeah thats why i was gone from the 7th to the 12th i think</p>
        <p>or maybe it was another time</p>
        <p>i frankly do not know</p>
        <p>oh wait i just realized that i did in fact explain it</p>
        <p>on jan. 19th</p>
        <p>but here's a more in-depth explanation i guess</p>
        <p>i finally got the escape pod order thing for the robot a while ago (don't know if i said that already)</p>
        <p>but here's a little review before the review</p>
        <p>i mean, it works i guess</p>
        <p>this is probably entirely because i decided to cheap out and got the cheapest raspberry pi i could find on amazon, but the response times are really slow</p>
        <p>but like i said its likely because the raspberry pi i got is a Model 3B with 1 GB of ram</p>
        <p>for context, they recommend a Pi 4 with 2, 4, or 8 GB of ram</p>
        <p>but it does work so</p>
        <p>i really like how you can customize the keywords for each commands</p>
        <p>that's a really nice feature to have, especially when they deliver my OSKR</p>
        <p>oh yeah, forgot to mention that</p>
        <p>they have not sent my OSKR yet</p>
        <p>now, at first i gave them the benefit of the doubt, as a few days after i submitted the form, the west had one of the worst snowstorms i've ever experienced, so i can imagine that the lads down at Digital Dream Labs had to stay home for a few days</p>
        <p>it could also be argued that they're still stuck at home, i mean, it is pennsylvania we're talking about here</p>
        <p>except they're not</p>
        <p>because i got a silly little email in my silly little inbox this morning from them</p>
        <p>well i guess it was yesterday evening at about 6:41 PM EST</p>
        <p>but i only saw it this morning</p>
        <p>anyways it was something about their support ticket system being messed up for a while and that they fixed it, but my tickets were supposedly going through fine so i dont know what that's about</p>
        <p>anyways it just proves that the fellas down in pennsylvania are very much at work</p>
        <p>i submitted a ticket, but i kinda feel bad for submitting so many tickets</p>
        <p>i mean sure, this is only my second ticket, but still i feel bad</p>
        <p>although DDL are the ones in the wrong for not sending my product</p>
        <p>i'll give them a few days but man</p>
        <p>i really want this OSKR</p>
        <p>it seems so awesome</p>
        <p>i find it interesting just reading the documentation, imagine how fun it would be to actually do the things they do in the documentation!</p>
        <p>hopefully i'll get it soon, and when/if i do, i'll update here.</p>
