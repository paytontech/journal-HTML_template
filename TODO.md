# TODO (journal-HTML)
**bold** = in progress
- [ ] **Use Vue (possibly) to make navigation easy by automating it**
- [ ] ~~Give every page an HTML title~~ (not doing this - would take too much time that i simply do not have)
- [x] slight redesign (likely just changing the background and text color)
- [ ] **make a seperate template repo so people can make their own journal-HTML**
- [ ] make making a new page easier (maybe cli idk)
- [x] fixing style.css for index.html
